# Wiki

My goal is to use this wiki as a way to export knowledge and ideas. Most people would use a blog for this, but blogs are too temporally oriented. A lot of what I want to blog about requires a lot of context that I have no way to reference. Here I can bootstrap that context.

This wiki will focus on old projects, philosophies, and incubating ideas. A lot of my projects, ideas, and knowledge around platforms and distributed systems will live on the Glider Labs wiki and open to more collaboration. Until that comes online, they'll live here.
